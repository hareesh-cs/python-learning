Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Ukraine is preparing for a new Russian offensive in the eastern region of the country and pledged to fight for “every meter” of Ukrainian territory, Al Jazeera reports. Despite Russia’s announcement that it will pull back forces from near Ukraine’s capital and the northern city of Chernihiv, explosions were heard in Kyiv on Wednesday morning, the BBC reports. The governor of Donetsk Oblast said on Wednesday that Russian forces were shelling several towns and cities on the border that separates Ukrainian and Russian-controlled areas in the region.
